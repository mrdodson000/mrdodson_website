      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Maxwell Dodson and I am a freshman at the University of Illinois studying mathematics. I’ve lived a couple different places now, but I have spent most of my life in and around Seattle, Washington. I have a wide variety of academic interests, ranging from my beloved mathematics to historical research, philosophy, and computer programming. Here on campus I can be found failing at Putnam problems on Monday evenings, playing table top roleplaying games with the Illini Metagamers, and studying Latin vocabulary in the Grainger Engineering Library—there’s so much vocabulary! Outside of my academics, I enjoy creative writing, cooking, and hiking, especially in the mountains back home. If you want to talk about any of these things, you can reach me at mdodson3@illinois.edu</p>

<p>This is a test page to see if I can get github pages to actually
work. Good luck, me!</p>

<p>Below is a test code snippet. Hopefully it works!</p>
<pre><code>
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
	if (array[i] % 2 != 0) {
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
