  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <div class="about-me">
    <p>I think my biggest take away so far is that I am a lot more capable than I thought I was. In high school, I looked at people who had the energy to engage in lots of extracircular activities in awe because I never did and I often felt that was just a problem with me. However, what I have discovered since coming to UIUC is that I am totally capable of this high energy lifestyle. When I focus on taking care of myself and living a healthy life, the energy comes fairly naturally. That realization is comforting to me because it tells me that all I have to do in order to meet my goals is to keep on the path that I am on and put in as much effort as I can. That’s not easy, of course, but it is straightforward and having a clear sense of what needs to be done is helpful. Even being away from home for such a short time, I have become more confident and I think that, despite the stress and occasional difficulties in life, I’m happy. In the coming years, I hope to keep going down that road, staying happy and improving my personal confidence while becoming more capable in domains that matter to me.</p>
