  <div class="about-me">
    <p>These first few weeks of university have been quite the transition for me. I was fairly miserable the first two years of high school before I transferred to an online high school, which I liked quite a bit more. Part of the reason, I imagined, that online high school was so much more comfortable for me was significantly reduced social activity and the absence of overstimulating environments such as loud crowded hallways. The primary thing that I was worried about, coming into university, was that these things I imagined had made me miserable in high school would come back and I would be in misery again. However, that hasn’t really happened.</p>
    <p>I’ve enjoyed the chance to talk to my classmates face to face and even extremely overwhelming environments like the dining hall at peak hour haven’t really bothered me at all. Whatever the reason for this change, I’ve gotten significantly more confident in my ability to maintain my well being because of it. Making connections with people is another I expected to struggle with and while I have struggled with it a bit I do think I’m forming pretty decent friendships with a couple folks around campus through classes, RSOs, and just stumbling into people who share my interests. I wouldn’t describe any of these friendships as particularly strong but that’s okay, strong friendships take time. My confidence has improved in this topic, although probably only from a 2/5 to a 3/5.</p>
