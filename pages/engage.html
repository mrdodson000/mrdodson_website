  <h1>Engage</h1>
  <div class="about-me">
    <p>Despite how frantic these first few weeks have been, I think that I’ve done a fairly good job engaging with the opportunities available here at UIUC. I’ve attended a few academic clubs, the Special Interest Group for Mathematics and Algorithms and the Putnam exam training group, as well as a fun social club, the Illini Metagamers, who play table top roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons. These have all been good experiences and it has been nice getting to know people who have interests similar to mine. I’ve also been to a lot of events, probably the most notable so far being a talk hosted by the Association for Computing Machinery here on campus on the company Neuralink, hosted by one of its founders. That was an incredible event and I’m certainly looking forward to other events of that kind in the near future.</p>
    <p>I’m not sure there’s a particular class that stands out as my favorite, I’ve been enjoying most of them. I quite like my Latin class because I think that there is enormous value in reading what ancient texts we have in their original tongue; it’s amazing to see how similar people two thousand years ago were to us today. My favorite study space is certainly the third floor of the Grainger Engineering Library. I spend a significant amount of time there on the weekends. Strangely enough, I think the most impactful thing I’ve done so far is start going to the gym semi-regularly. My health has noticeably improved already and I feel better than I have felt the past two years, which has helped in navigating the transition to university.</p>
