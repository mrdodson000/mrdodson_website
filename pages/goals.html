    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <div class="about-me">
      <h2>Goal 1: Publish Research In Mathematics</h2>
      <p>I love mathematics very much and it is important to me that I am able to engage with modern mathematics throughout my adult life, even if I do not ultimately become a mathematics researcher. College provides a uniquely good opportunity to build up my mathematical skills and I feel that being able to publish, or at the very least write, a meaningful mathematics research paper is a good indicator of whether or not I have achieved the capacity to engage with modern mathematics.</p>
      <div class="drop-down-button"> Actions</div>
      <div class="drop-down-content">
	<p>In order to engage with research mathematics, I will have to study graduate level mathematics independently. This is time consuming and so it is challenging to do this study with everything else going on. However, I already have access to the textbooks I need to do this so it is just a matter of putting aside a few hours each week to work on them. Progress will be slow, but I believe this is doable.</p>
	<p>One of the hardest parts of researching mathematics is finding a problem that you can reasonably approach. Many pieces of frontier mathematics are so obscure that someone who has not dedicated their career to studying that sub-domain has no hope of making any progress. I believe that the best strategy to seek out these approachable problems is to take advanced mathematics courses with professors engaged in active research. Through taking an advanced course, the professor will get to know me and my strengths, and so will have a sense of what problems in their field I might be suited to looking at.</p>
	<p>The final action that I will take in order to achieve this goal is to consistently apply for undergraduate research experiences in mathematics. These provide an excellent way into research and here at UIUC we are lucky enough to have many good ones. The two that are particularly interesting to me are the Illinois Mathematics Lab, in which Mathematics Department faculty host research projects, as well as the student internship opportunities at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.</p>

      <h2 class="right-justified">Goal 2: Secure Career Opportunities</h2>
      <p>Aside from developing my mathematical abilities, my other major professional goal for my time at university is to secure career opportunities for myself after graduation so that I can support myself and live comfortably. As with developing my mathematical abilities, university is a prime time in my life to secure these sort of opportunities as many companies are looking to employ talented recent graduates and it is a time in my life where my career path is not yet set, so I have lots of option</p>
      <div class="drop-down-button"> Actions</div>
      <div class="drop-down-content">
	<p>The first thing I would like to do in this regard is to apply for (and hopefully attain) high quality internships. With internship applications requiring somewhat less effort than a college application, applying for them is not too bad, but it still a time consuming and, I find, exhausting activity. Nonetheless, I think I have the capacity to apply for a handful of internships every week, maybe two or three, and so I will attempt to do this.</p>
	<p>The second thing I will attempt to do is keep in touch with our career center and use their services as extensively as I can. I have already employed their resume review service and I will certainly be using it again, but I think I should also take advantage of their mock interviews, their cover letter reviews, as well as career advising appointments. The career center offers these, but so do our departmental advisors and I think I will try and find a time to get career advising from both sources this semester.</p>
	<p>The final thing I will do to achieve this goal is to consistently attend events. Career fairs are obviously valuable in this context, but I have also found that organizations here on campus such as the Association for Computing Machinery and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics host extremely valuable career events where students can hear from and speak to engineers working at major companies. My goal here is simply to make time for as many of these events as possible, when they present themselves.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Goal 3: Improve My Health</h2>
      <p>I have always struggled with my health, especially my weight, and I would like to do significantly better in that regard during my time in college. Having better health makes everything else easier because it simply makes you feel much better. I’ve struggled in the past with an inability to focus and constant fatigue, something which I blame upon poor health at that time. I’m doing a little better now, and as a result I find it much easier to complete all my schoolwork and then work toward my other goals on top of that. Thus, I would like to continue down that path of improving my health.</p>
      <div class="drop-down-button"> Actions</div>
      <div class="drop-down-content">
	<p>The simplest action to improve my health is one that I am already taking, but which I must continue doing: exercising regularly. I’ve managed to get to the ARC roughly three times a week, but keeping on top of this, especially when classwork is busy and there are so many other things to do, can be quite difficult. Thus, this first action is to just stick to this schedule each week so that I can see the benefits over time. I’ve already lost approximately ten pounds and have gained appreciable strength in my upper body since the semester started, so that is a good start.</p>
	<p>For my second action, I will schedule a meeting with a nutritionist at McKinley. I’ve always had a hard time eating properly, probably the cause for most of my weight problems, and part of this struggle is not really knowing what I should be eating. I know that I have some lingering health troubles that exercise alone hasn’t seemed to fix, so I hope that a meeting, or perhaps several meetings over the course of the next few semesters, can fix those by insuring that I eat properly.</p>
	<p>Finally, I will schedule an appointment with a doctor, at McKinley or elsewhere, to begin to address some more fundamental health issues that I suspect I may have. For example, my family has something of a history of diabetes and given my extended period at a high weight, I am certainly susceptible. If I have any more problematic underlying medical conditions, it is very important for my health going forward that I am aware of them and taking steps to address them. </p>
