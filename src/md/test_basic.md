# Basic Math Test

This is a simple test with inline math like $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ and some text.

Here's a block equation:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

And some more inline: $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$.

## Quadratic Formula

The solution to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

This is a fundamental formula in algebra.

This is some random crap I'm adding to see if this works. Maybe file creation doesn't actually count as a diff (that would be funny lol). TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST PLEASE WORK.
